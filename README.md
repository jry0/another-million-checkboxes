I'm trying to recreate the viral One Million Checkboxes game (https://github.com/nolenroyalty/one-million-checkboxes) but following best practices using Python, FastAPI, and Poetry.


Goals:
[x] Follow [conventional commits](conventionalcommits.org).
[] Deploy a live version.
[] Set up rate limiting.
[] Because users of the original game have developed bots, implement User Auth / anti-botting measures.
[] Scale to multiple millions of checkboxes.
[] Set up logging.
[] Maintain consistency.
[] Testing (unit/integration)
[] Fault tolerance testing (chaos engineering)
[] Potentially recreate everything in Go as well.
[] Play around with UI development (coming from no experience)
[] Implement User Leaderboard
[] Distributed Locking
[] Event broadcasting
[] Documentation
[] CI/CD
